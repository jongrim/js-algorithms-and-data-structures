# Alorithms and Data Structures
As part of my study of programming and computer science, I find it useful to practice implementations of various classic algorithms and data structures. While the implementation of these is seldom necessary in everyday programming, especially with a language such as JavaScript, a fundamental understanding is useful for conceptualizing the work necessary to achieve effecient processing and helps inform future decisions.
